# Classification of Elite and Sub Elite Goalkeepers in professional men’s football using multiple machine learning algorithms.


* Data Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy
* Dataset: Football data from several elite European leagues over five seasons (2013/2014–2017/2018) obtained from Opta Sports.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify anomalies, missing values, and trends.
* Developed and engineered features to enhance model performance and facilitate more accurate predictions. Employed techniques such as normalization, encoding, and dimensionality reduction to optimize the   
  input data.
* Classification algorithms used:  Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost) using scikit-learn.
* Utilized cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve model robustness and prevent overfitting.
•	Model evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
* Documented methodologies, generated visualizations, and provided actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making.
